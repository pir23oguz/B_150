    "- **fnlwgt:** this is the number of people the census believes the entry represents. People with similar demographic characteristics should have similar weights.  There is one important caveat to remember about this statement. That is that since the CPS sample is actually a collection of 51 state samples, each with its own probability of selection, the statement only applies within state.(Integer greater than 0)\n",

    "- **education-num:** the highest level of education achieved in numerical form. (Integer greater than 0)\n",
    "- **marital-status:** marital status of an individual. Married-civ-spouse corresponds to a civilian spouse while Married-AF-spouse is a spouse in the Armed Forces.

    "- **occupation:** the general type of occupation of an individual. (Tech-support, Craft-repair, Other-service, Sales, Exec-managerial, Prof-specialty, Handlers-cleaners, Machine-op-inspct, Adm-clerical, Farming-fishing, Transport-moving, Priv-house-serv, Protective-serv, Armed-Forces)\n",
    "- **relationship:** represents what this individual is relative to others. For example an individual could be a Husband. Each entry only has one relationship attribute. (Wife, Own-child, Husband, Not-in-family, Other-relative, Unmarried)\n",
    "- **race:** Descriptions of an individual’s race. (White, Asian-Pac-Islander, Amer-Indian-Eskimo, Other, Black)\n",
    "- **sex:** the biological sex of the individual. (Male, female)\n",
    "- **capital-gain:** capital gains for an individual. (Integer greater than or equal to 0)\n",
    "- **capital-loss:** capital loss for an individual. (Integer greater than or equal to 0)\n",
    "- **hours-per-week:** the hours an individual has reported to work per week. (continuous)\n",
    "- **native-country:** country of origin for an individual (United-States, Cambodia, England, Puerto-Rico, Canada, Germany, Outlying-US(Guam-USVI-etc), India, Japan, Greece, South, China, Cuba, Iran, Honduras, Philippines, Italy, Poland, Jamaica, Vietnam, Mexico, Portugal, Ireland, France, Dominican-Republic, Laos, Ecuador, Taiwan, Haiti, Columbia, Hungary, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Scotland, Thailand, Yugoslavia, El-Salvador, Trinadad&Tobago, Peru, Hong, Holand-Netherlands)"
